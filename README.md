# Welcome to the Frontend

This is a simple Angular webapp which shows the bins and the items present in the bins in a tabular manner.

## To get the frontend up and running,
1. Before running the frontend, get the [backend](https://github.com/prasadsawant5/tello-backend) up and rinning.
2. Install `angular-cli` by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` in the terminal window/command prompt.
   - For Linux environments, you might have to run `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3. Then navigate to the frontend's root directory from the command prompt by typing `cd <frontend's root directory>` in the terminal window/command prompt.
> __Note__: Please don't type `<frontend's root directory>` in the window. The root directory differs from system to system. On my system, the root directory is `/home/ericsson/Documents/frontend`. It might be something else on your system.
4. Install necessary dependencies by running `npm install --save` in the root directory
5. Then run the webapp by typing `ng serve` in the terminal window/command prompt.
> __Note__: Please keep the terminal window/command prompt open all the time.
